# Tanimoto random features

Contains a rough implementation of Tanimoto random features in Jax.
For details, see <http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14809>.

## Development

### Installation

Need Jax and numpy.

### Formatting

Use pre-commit to enforce formatting, large file checks, etc.

If not already installed in your environment, run:

```bash
conda install pre-commit
```

To install the precommit hooks:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

Now a series of useful checks will be run before any commit.
